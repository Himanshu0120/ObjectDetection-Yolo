# ObjectDetection-Yolo
This repository contains python implementation of YoloV3 object detection model usign OpenCv.

Yolo(You only look once) is the state of the art algorithm for real time object detection which has been trined on MS COCO dataset which has 80 labels that means the model can detect 80 different categories of objects with high accuracy and speed.

This repository contains two python files-
* One is for object detection in images.
* Second one is for real time object detection from live camera.

The yolov3.weights file which is the pretrained weights file has to downloaded before ruuning the code.

### How to run the code-
* Download or clone the repository.
* Download the yolov3.weights file and copy it in the same directory.
* For object detection from live camera just run the LiveCam.py file.
* For object detection from image set the path of the image which is to be selected in Image.py file and run the code.
